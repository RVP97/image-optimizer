/**
 * Taps in open menus, sheets and dialogs on iPhone. While a Radix menu, sheet or dialog is open,
 * react-remove-scroll cancels every `touchmove` that no scrollable box inside it could take, so
 * the page behind can't scroll. A real finger drifts a few pixels during a tap, and iOS drops the
 * tap's `click` once one of its touchmoves is cancelled: buttons and links in an open menu or
 * dialog only worked when the finger didn't move at all.
 *
 * So, while a scroll lock is on (body[data-scroll-locked], set by react-remove-scroll), a
 * touchmove still inside the tap slop stops at the window and never reaches it: nothing scrolls
 * that early anyway, and the tap stays a tap. Past the slop it's a drag and the lock works as
 * before.
